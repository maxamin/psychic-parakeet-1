        help_text: "Client feedback surveys provide an opportunity for clients to
          give feedback on the services they received and key information to help
          your organization identify what is working well, possible challenges, and
          what needs to be improved in terms of service delivery.\nThe Client Feedback
          Survey can be given at case closure, when \n- Survivor’s needs have been
          met as described in the Case Action Plan\n- Survivor’s needs have been met
          to the extent possible\n- Survivor requests to close the case\n\nThe completion
          of a Client Feedback Survey should be voluntary and is anonymous. It is
          a means to elicit feedback on services to improve programming. In contexts
          where survivors may only seek services once, your organization may decide
          to use the Client Feedback form at the end of the first session, if it is
          feasible to do so.\n\nIn contexts where survivors receive services for longer
          periods of time, you can also consider administering client feedback surveys
          more frequently (e.g. on a monthly or quarterly basis).\nThe process for
          using them with a survivor should be as follows:\n\n(1) Explain to the person
          that the purpose is for you and your organization to improve your services,
          and that their feedback is valued. \n(2) Inform the person that the information
          will remain anonymous and that it will not impact the services they currently
          receive or may need in the future. And ultimately, it is their choice as
          to whether they complete the survey. \n(3) A different caseworker, supervisor
          or other relevant staff member should be the one who gives the survey to
          the person and collects it from them at the end. For literate clients, this
          can be done independently through a paper form or an electronic form (handheld
          device) in which the person does not have to provide their name, just the
          name of the caseworker with whom they worked. "

        help_text: "Instructions for staff:\n-Identify who on your team is going to
          administer the feedback form. Identify whether it will be done in writing
          (giving the person the questionnaire to complete themselves) or whether
          a staff member will ask the questions and record the person’s answers.\n-Inform
          the person that you will ask them some questions but will not write their
          name on the form and that the interview will remain anonymous.\n-Explain
          the purpose. Say: 'This questionnaire is voluntary and confidential. Its
          purpose is to collect information about the services that have been provided
          to you and to help make improvements in the quality of care that GBV survivors
          receive in this community.'\n-Remind the person that you will not ask them
          any questions about their actual case, but are just interested in the services
          they received throughout the case management process. \n-Get consent to
          proceed or if the person declines, tell the person that it is ok and if
          they change their minds they can contact you."
