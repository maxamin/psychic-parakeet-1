        help_text: 'Safety planning enables the survivor to proceed with a pre-determined
          course of action when she is in a lifethreatening situation. Safety planning
          can help her minimize the harm done by the perpetrator by identifying resources
          and means to avoid harm and places she can go temporarily for safety. Developing
          a safety plan is a collaborative process undertaken by the casework and
          survivor together. The safety plan addresses the fundamental question: what
          needs to happen or  to be in place in order for the survivor to safe? It
          includes identifying: dangerous situations, risks and warning signs, activities

          supportive people that make sruvivor feel safe and  survivor''s own stregngths
          that help her get by.'
