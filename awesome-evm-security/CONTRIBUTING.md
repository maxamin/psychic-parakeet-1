# Contribution Guidelines

## Adding something to the list

If you have something awesome to contribute to the list, feel free to open a PR. I will not approve every submission, so please don't take it personal.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, I will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
