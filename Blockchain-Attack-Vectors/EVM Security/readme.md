# EVM Security

EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. It's the decentralized computer that runs smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The EVM executes code written in Solidity (or other Ethereum-compatible programming languages) and handles the state changes and interactions between smart contracts and users.

EVM Security refers to the measures and practices implemented to ensure the secure operation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and the smart contracts running on it. Security is of paramount importance in the blockchain space because once a smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network, it becomes immutable, and any vulnerabilities or flaws in the code can lead to serious consequences, including the loss of funds.
