# Blockchain-Attack-Vectors

The Blockchain-Attack-Vectors directory acts as an Open Directory for the Web3 community, which is built to reference, categorize, and mitigate the various attack vectors on a blockchain. This repo consists of a category-wise explanation of the attack behaviors and prevention strategies for vulnerabilities specific to the Web3 ecosystem.

This directory is a work in progress, and we [invite contributors](https://github.com/ImmuneBytes-Security-Audit/Blockchain-Attack-Vectors/fork) from the Web3 space to help us design a framework that is a go-to stop for budding Web3 enthusiasts and security researchers.

## üéØ Aim

* With this directory, we aim to bring about a **sense of awareness in the community about the different types of attack vectors** that have been the cause of the loss of millions in the past.
* Provide the **security researchers, developers, auditors, and engineers** with a one-stop knowledge base for better understanding.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* **Comprehensive Catalog:** This directory acts as an extensive knowledge base for anyone looking to build a career in Web3. The attack vectors are classified extensively with an in-depth explanation.
* **Mitigation Techniques:** Each attack vector also contains Mitigation techniques to get a deeper understanding of how to prevent/mitigate the attack.
* **Real-world Use Cases:** Along with the attack understanding, readers will also come across real-world hacks (wherever applicable) and learn how the vector can be exploited.
* **Community Building:** This is a community-leveraged framework wherein we encourage community members from Web3 to impart their knowledge and help other members as well.

## ‚è© How Can You Contribute?

* Explore the catalog and get an understanding of how the framework has been designed.
* If you think something is missing, _create a new fork_ of this [repo](https://github.com/ImmuneBytes-Security-Audit/Blockchain-Attack-Vectors) and get started.
* Pick a category and make your submission for publication.
* Once reviewed, the attack vector will be published on the repo. üöÄ
* You can also let us know if you find any discrepancies or a need for change in the existing content.
