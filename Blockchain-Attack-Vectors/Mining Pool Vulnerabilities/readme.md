A mining pool is a group of individual miners who combine their computational resources (computing power and hashing capabilities) to collectively solve complex mathematical problems and earn rewards in a more predictable and consistent manner. Mining pools are commonly associated with Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain networks like Bitcoin, although they can also exist for other PoW-based cryptocurrencies.

Mining pools can be susceptible to various vulnerabilities and risks, which can impact the profitability and security of the participants. Some of the common vulnerabilities and issues associated with mining pools include Centralization Risks, 51% Attacks, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks, etc.

This section explains the attack vectors specific to Mining Pools. Happy learning!
