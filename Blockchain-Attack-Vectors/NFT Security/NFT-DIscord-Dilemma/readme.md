### **NFT Discord Dilemma: The Rise of Social Media Exploits**

### **1. Introduction**

The surge in NFT popularity has brought with it a wave of cyber threats, particularly on platforms like Discord, where NFT communities thrive. We will  delves into the intricacies of these attacks, their methodologies, and preventive measures.

### **2. The Discord-NFT Nexus**

Discord serves as a hub for NFT enthusiasts, artists, developers, and investors to discuss and share insights. However, its widespread use in the NFT realm has made it a prime target for cybercriminals.

### **3. The Surge in Discord Exploits**

The lack of comprehensive information about NFTs, both online and offline, has rendered them susceptible to scams and hacks. Since May 2022, there's been a notable uptick in Discord hacks related to NFTs, with losses surpassing $22M.

### **4. Anatomy of the Attack**

- Initial Breach:** Attackers infiltrate NFT-related Discord servers using techniques like phishing, exploiting bot vulnerabilities, or leveraging unsecured accounts.
- Deception:** Once inside, they disseminate malicious links, often masked as exclusive NFT offers or giveaways. These links prey on the FOMO (fear of missing out) sentiment, urging users to act swiftly.
- Execution:** Unsuspecting users, lured by the promise of exclusive content, click on these links, inadvertently granting hackers access to their wallets or personal information.

### **5. Common Exploitation Techniques**

- Social Engineering:** Attackers impersonate administrators or trusted community members to spread phishing links.
- Bot Vulnerabilities:** Flaws in popular Discord plugins, such as Dyno and MEE6, can be exploited to gain unauthorized access.
- Unsecured Accounts:** Lack of basic security measures, like 2FA, can make Discord accounts easy targets.

### **6. Notable Incidents**

- Bored Ape Yacht Club Hack:** In June 2022, attackers made off with NFTs worth around 200 ETH ($360,000) after compromising the Discord account of the project's community manager.
- Fractal's Breach:** In December 2021, Fractal's Discord was compromised, leading to a loss of $150,000 in $SOL. The attackers exploited the server's webhooks to broadcast fake mint links.

### **7. Immediate Response to Hacks**

- Communication:** Inform the community about the breach to prevent further victimization.
- Password Reset:** Change the server's password immediately to regain control.
- Financial Security:** Remove all payment details linked to the Discord account to prevent monetary losses.

### **8. Defensive Measures**

- Awareness:** Users should familiarize themselves with common scam techniques, such as phishing.
- Link Verification:** Always double-check links received on Discord or other platforms.
- DM Caution:** Direct messages are a common scam avenue. It's advisable to keep DMs closed or be highly skeptical of unsolicited messages.
- Guard Personal Information:** Never share private details, even if the requester claims to be from a trusted community.

### **9. Conclusion**

The intersection of NFTs and social media platforms like Discord has created a new frontier for cyber threats. As the NFT landscape continues to evolve, users and communities must prioritize security to safeguard their assets and information.
