### **Self-Destruct Exploit: Forced Ether Injection in Solidity Contracts**

### Introduction

The **`selfdestruct`** function in Solidity provides a mechanism for contract termination and balance transfer, but it comes with inherent security risks. One of the prominent vulnerabilities it can introduce is forced ether injection into a target contract, altering its state and potentially breaking its logic. This attack vector examines how a contract can be vulnerable to such an attack and how to mitigate it.

### Understanding Self-Destruct in Solidity

In Solidity, the **`selfdestruct(address payable recipient)`** function transfers all Ether from the contract to a specified recipient address and removes the contract's bytecode, rendering it inoperative. If the recipient address is a contract, it receives the Ether without any of its functions being called, not even the fallback function.

### Attack Scenario: Breaking EtherGame

Let's look at an example contract called **`EtherGame`**, which is based on **[Solidity by example](https://solidity-by-example.org/hacks/self-destruct/)**.

```solidity
solidityCopy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract EtherGame {
    uint public targetAmount = 7 ether;
    address public winner;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "You can only send 1 Ether");

        uint balance = address(this).balance;
        require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

        if (balance == targetAmount) {
            winner = msg.sender;
        }
    }

    function claimReward() public {
        require(msg.sender == winner, "Not winner");

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}

```

In this simple game, players send 1 Ether to the contract, aiming to be the one who makes the total balance reach 7 Ether. The first player to do so becomes the winner and can claim the reward.

### **Vulnerability Details**

An attacker can create another contract with a **`selfdestruct`** function and send enough Ether to break the game logic. For example, sending 5 Ether to the contract will make its balance reach or exceed the target amount, thereby making it impossible for any player to win the game.

### Mitigation Strategies

The attack can be prevented by not relying on **`address(this).balance`** for critical game logic. Instead, use a self-maintained state variable to track the deposited Ether.

Here's a safer version of the **`EtherGame`** contract:

```solidity
solidityCopy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract EtherGame {
    uint public targetAmount = 7 ether;
    uint public balance;
    address public winner;

    function deposit() public payable {
        require(msg.value == 1 ether, "You can only send 1 Ether");

        balance += msg.value;
        require(balance <= targetAmount, "Game is over");

        if (balance == targetAmount) {
            winner = msg.sender;
        }
    }

    function claimReward() public {
        require(msg.sender == winner, "Not winner");

        (bool sent, ) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        require(sent, "Failed to send Ether");
    }
}

```

In this revised version, we keep track of the deposited Ether with our own **`balance`** state variable. This makes the contract resilient against forced Ether injections via **`selfdestruct`**.

### Conclusion

While the **`selfdestruct`** function has legitimate uses, it can be a significant security risk if misused or misunderstood. It is crucial to be aware of its implications and to follow best practices in smart contract development to mitigate associated risks.
