# Bridges

Bridges typically refer to a mechanism or protocol that facilitates the transfer of assets or data between two different blockchain networks. These bridges play a crucial role in achieving interoperability between blockchains, as different blockchain networks may have their own unique rules, consensus mechanisms, and token standards.

However, blockchain bridges are susceptible to various types of attacks and vulnerabilities, such as Oracle Data Manipulation, Centralization risks, Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, and more, much like other components of blockchain technology. The security of a bridge is crucial because it involves the transfer of assets or data between different blockchain networks.

This section explains the various attack vectors specific to Blockchain Bridges. Happy learning!
