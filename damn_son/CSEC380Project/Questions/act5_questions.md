## How would you fix your code so that these issues were no longer present?
You can prevent these types of attacks by introducing sanitization anywhere there is user input. User input should be treated as untrustworthy. To prevent this from happening you should not use dynamic SQL, this means to avoid putting user input straight into SQL statements. Instead, you should use prepared statements and parameterizes queries. Ways to sanitize user input include properly escaping dangerous characters.

## What are the limitations, if any that, of the SQL Injection issues youâ€™ve included?
There are two areas for SQLi in the web app. The first area is at the login and registration page. SQLi here provides the functionality of logging in as the admin user without having to know the credentials. This could be done using (username' OR 1=1 -- ). You could try UNION injection but since nothing is returned the information you could gather is limited. The second area for SQLi is once logged into memetube you are able to search the uploaded videos. Both SQLi are limited because PHP does not allow for stacked queries with MYSQL. If this wasn't the case we would be able to modify and even delete other entries or tables.
