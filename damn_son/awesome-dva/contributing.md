# Contribution Guidelines

This list is compiled and curated from [OWASP VWAD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/OWASP-VWAD/) 
as a reference. Not everything from OWASP VWAD necessarily makes it here, and we focus on offline/VMs only
so they are easy to study - a different awesome list should be compiled for online wargames and active
CTF competitions.

If you want to add to this list, add/update OWASP VWAD, that way both sources stay in sync. If you want to
curate this list further, open an issue and we can strike it from the list if it's too obsolete to be useful.
Remember that you may not have the same skill level as another practitioner, and what is too easy/hard, obscure/important to you might not be for another person interested in application security.
