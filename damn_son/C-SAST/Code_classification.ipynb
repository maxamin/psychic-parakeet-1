    "There  are  two  widely  used  sources  ofvulnerability  data  maintained  by  the  NIST:  the  NVD  which  contains  vulnerabilities  in  production  software,  andthe  SARD  project which  contains  production,  synthetic,and  academic  security  flaws  or  vulnerabilities.  In  the  NVD,each  vulnerability  has  a  unique  Common  Vulnerabilities  andExposures  IDentifier  (CVE  ID)  and  a  Common  WeaknessEnumeration  IDentifier  (CWE  ID)  that  indicates  the  type  ofthe  vulnerability  in  question.  We  collect  the  programs  thatcontain  one  or  multiple  vulnerabilities.  In  the  SARD,  eachprogram (i.e., test case) corresponds to one or multiple CWEIDs because a program can have multiple types of vulnerabil-ities. Therefore, programs with one or multiple CWE IDs arecollected.\n",

    "Machine  learning  algorithms  cannot  learn  from  raw  text;so  several  steps  of  processing  the  dataset  are  needed  beforetraining  the  algorithm.  First,  the  code  snippets  need  to  beconverted  into  numerical  feature  vectors.  We  used  bag-of-word  model,  a  method  to  represent  each  unique  word  as  afeature. Second, we selected features extracted a subset fromthe dataset and used them for training the machine algorithm.\n",
